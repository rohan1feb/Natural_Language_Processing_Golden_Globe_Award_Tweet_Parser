Approach

We have a dataset of 17,54,153 tweets relating to the Golden Globe Awards. 

We have used natural language processing techniques to parse tweets.
We have performed preprocessing on the dataset - removing opiniated tweets. 
We used BeautifulSoup to scrape the top 1000 actors and actresses fromt the imdb website. This is to cross check if the names that we extract truly exists.
We have used regex and built various functions to extract host names, award names, presenter names, nominee names, winner names, and display the output.
